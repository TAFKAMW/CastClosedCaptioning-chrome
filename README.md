# Closed Captioning

This Google Cast demo application shows how to control closed captioning for a receiver app using a custom namespace. Chromecast supports both WebVTT and TTML for closed captioning. This sample uses WebVTT files.

* Chrome browser.
* Google Cast Extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-cast/boadgeojelhgndaghljhdicfkmllpafd

## Setup Instructions
* Get a Chromecast device and get it set up for development: https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/developers#Get_started
* Register an application on the Developers Console (http://cast.google.com/publish). Select the Custom Receiver option and specify the URL to where you are hosting the closedcaptioningreceiver.html file (You can use Google Drive to host your files: https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2881970?hl=en). You will get an App ID when you finish registering your application.
